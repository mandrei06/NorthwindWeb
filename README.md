This project uses Thymeleaf to generate webpages for interacting with the Northwind database.

The database can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/mandrei06/Northwind/blob/dev/Northwind.MySQL5.sql).

Please make sure you change the infos in the application.properties [file](https://github.com/mandrei06/NorthwindWeb/blob/dev/src/main/resources/application.properties).

In that project the user can perform CRUD functionalities over the database. 

In this project is an example of how to use sessions to temporary store variables.
